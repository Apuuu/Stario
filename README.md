### Is a game like Factorio but without Conveyor Belts (Yes very nice)
#### It utilizes your GPU to render the scene which allows really cool stuff to do.
#### For saving the current state of the Game i used an MariaDB SQL Database

#### Modding, adding new Content:
I tried making it as easy as possible to add new Stuff. So far adding new Items is ultra easy by just adding stuff in the corresponding Files inside the scripts/buildings/data Folder.
For new buildings i will somewhen provide a simple building Class which can be adjusted to your likings. In the current state it will also need some adjustments in the main.js file.
